## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This application is built using a modern Windows stack:

- **Language:** **C#** - The core application logic is written in C#, the primary language for .NET development.
- **Framework:** **.NET & WPF** - The app is built on the **.NET** platform with **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** for the user interface, ensuring a responsive and native experience.
- **UI Library:** **WPF-UI** - To achieve a modern look and feel, and to handle automatic light/dark theme switching, the project uses the **WPF-UI** library (<https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui>). This provides WinUI / Fluent controls and styles.
- **Raster Image Processing:** **ImageSharp** - used for reading standard image files (PNG, JPG, etc.), resizing them, and encoding the final multi-resolution `.ico` file.
- **Vector Graphics (SVG):** **Svg.Skia** - To support SVG files, **Svg.Skia** library is used. It parses SVG documents and uses SkiaSharp for rendering of the vector graphic to a bitmap, which can then be colorized and converted.
